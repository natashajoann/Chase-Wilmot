    <p> I offer one-on-one bespoke coaching programs that vary in time period and content depending on the client. My sessions meet over Zoom, with each session being 75 minutes long to offer us extensive time to work through what is present for the client in service to their goals and dreams. </p>

    <h3>CURRENT PROGRAM</h3>
    <h4>Living in Divine Collaboration and Cooperation | 4 MONTH PROGRAM | June - September 2020</h4>
      <br> <br>
    <p>What is it that lights up your soul and drives you to keep going? What are you feeling called to create?
      <br> <br>
    Is it a new career? A piece of music? Or maybe more time to relax? Whatever it is, it’s here to show you something.
      <br> <br>
    This course is about listening to those wants, visions, and dreams and following them down the path of divine inspiration. It’s on this path that we are shown what we are here to do, where we can grow, and where to sit still and just be.
