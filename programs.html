    <h3>CURRENT PROGRAM</h3>
    <h4>To Be Heard: A Course on Deep Listening | 5-WEEK PROGRAM | September-October 2020</h4>
    <p class="present-before-paste">I&rsquo;m finding that in these unique times we are living in, one of the most important skills we can practice is Listening. It&rsquo;s an avenue of deep solidarity and support to whoever you are listening to, and on the flip side of that, the experience of being heard, fully and truly, can be healing on so many levels.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="present-before-paste">The program will also explore the topic of intuition and listening inwardly to our inner guidance and wisdom as a key tool to showing up in a healthy and purposeful relationship to oneself.</p>
    <p class="present-before-paste">Deep Listening has the potential to cultivate huge growth and connection for everyone who partakes on all sides of the experience.</p>
    <p class="present-before-paste"><strong>This program will be an exploration of:</strong></p>
    <p class="present-before-paste"><em>How to help someone feel deeply heard</em></p>
    <p class="present-before-paste"><em>Looking for the answers within;&nbsp;</em><em>Intuition</em></p>
    <p class="present-before-paste"><em>Neutral observation; how to listen in a more powerful way</em></p>
    <p class="present-before-paste"><em>Uncovering what people are *really* saying</em><em></em></p>
    <p class="present-before-paste"><em>The &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; context</em></p>
    <p class="present-before-paste"><strong>This course is for YOU if:</strong></p>
    <p class="present-before-paste"><em>You are looking for ways to heal or deepen important relationships in your life</em></p>

The program will be a container of great support and love for you as you develop practical skills and look to places inside of you that could use extra healing and support.</p>
    <p class="present-before-paste">There will be opportunities for break out discussions and facilitation for each participant to learn to hold space for others in the group as well as develop connections with fellow participants. I will be leading short group meditations with journal prompts to follow, to give time to cultivate the skill of listening to one&rsquo;s Inner Guidance. And of course, there will be ample time and space for coaching and support from me!</p>

    <p class="present-before-paste"><strong>Past Participant Remarks:</strong></p>
    <p class="present-before-paste">"During a time of immense stress and unknowns in my life, I attended a small-group workshop that Chase facilitated. While I wasn't sure what to expect going in, I came away feeling incredibly supported and overall much lighter. In her workshop, Chase made space for a range of emotions, thoughts, and feelings that came up in the group, and she encouraged engagement with these experiences through various avenues. Chase's creative and hands-on workshop helped shape new ways for me to connect with myself and my goals that I still use today. " ~ BG</p>
    <p class="present-before-paste">&ldquo;Chase sees people and she meets them exactly where they are. I've never felt so upheld or supported by someone who is so open and relentlessly loving. Chase's honesty is humble, kind, and disarming. I always walk away from every gathering with a greater sense of understanding of myself&ndash; not to mention a community of sisters.&rdquo; ~ LC</p>
