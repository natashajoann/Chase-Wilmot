    <h2>I'm Chase, and I am passionate about <span class="highlight-2"> supporting people in cultivating loving and powerful relationships with themselves</span>, rooted in emotional and spiritual wellness, in service to their <span class="highlight-2">heart-felt goals and dreams.</span></h2>

    <h3>Why Coaching?</h3>
    <p>Having the support of a coach was the most invaluable and influential investment in a moment when I needed it most. Through my coach's care, I learned a new way to care for myself, a new way to be my own best friend and biggest supporter. And in turn, I also learned a deeper compassion and way of caring for others. Coaching provided me a space to explore my experiences with no judgement, no expectations, and no boundaries, all alongside the loving guidance of a higher perspective. Through this opportunity, I was empowered and supported to follow my heart-felt dreams and create the life I wanted for myself.
      <br><br>
    After working with my coach for two years, I was inspired and thrilled by my experience and the value she brought to my life, and I realized my own desire to become a coach as well. While finishing my undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, I enrolled in a 10-month certification program at the University of Santa Monica, alongside other coaching courses, to work on myself and to hone the skills needed to facilitate others in doing the same.</p>

    When I'm not working with clients or coming up with ideas for new workshops, I love to be out in nature, on a walk or swimming at the beach, cooking a delicious meal, or dancing to my favorite music on top volume at home.</p>
